🏥 Clinic Appointment Management System (Basic C Project)

This is a simple console-based Clinic Appointment Management System built using basic C programming concepts. It allows users to book, view, search, and manage appointments in a clinical setup. Designed for learning purposes or as a starting point for beginners in C.


---

📌 Problem Statement

Managing appointments manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project provides a command-line solution for small clinics to record and manage patient appointments with essential information like name, age, gender, doctor specialization, and appointment date.


---

✅ What I Concluded

Hands-on practice with C structs, arrays, strings, and conditionals.

Learned how to simulate a basic real-world system with a simple user interface.

Understood how to implement search, insert, and delete (cancel) operations using fundamental logic.



---

🔧 Technologies Used

C Programming Language (No external libraries or frameworks)

Console I/O (stdio.h, string.h)



---

📄 Features

📥 Book an Appointment

📃 View All Appointments

🔍 Search Appointment by Name

❌ Cancel Appointment by ID (Optional Enhancement)

👨‍⚕️ Choose Doctor by Specialization (e.g., Cardiologist, Dentist, General Physician)

📅 Appointment Date Entry



---

🧠 Concepts Used

Structures (struct)

Arrays of Structures

String Handling (gets(), strcmp(), strcpy())

Conditional Statements

Loops (do-while, for)

Basic Input/Output Handling

🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.


2. Open main.c in any C compiler (Turbo C, Code::Blocks, GCC, etc.)


3. Compile and run the program.


4. Use the menu-driven system to interact with the application.

🔒 Limitations

Uses deprecated gets() — should be replaced with fgets() for safety.

No persistent data (all data is lost after the program ends).

Limited to 10 appointments (can be increased by changing the MAX constant).



---

💡 Future Improvements

Store appointment data in files for persistence.

Add login system for admin/staff.

Integrate date/time validations.

GUI or Web-based front-end using HTML/CSS/JS (for advanced versions).
